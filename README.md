# Heart-Failure-Project
Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of death globally, responsible for approximately 17.9 million deaths each yearâ€”accounting for 31% of all deaths worldwide. Heart failure is a common outcome of CVDs, and this dataset includes 12 key features that can be utilized to predict mortality due to heart failure.

Fortunately, most cardiovascular diseases can be prevented by addressing behavioral risk factors such as tobacco use, unhealthy diets, obesity, physical inactivity, and harmful alcohol consumption through population-wide interventions. For individuals with cardiovascular diseases or those at high cardiovascular risk (due to factors such as hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, or established disease), early detection and effective management are critical. In such cases, machine learning models can play a pivotal role by providing timely and accurate predictions to assist in medical decision-making.

## Tasks:
1. Identify the age range most susceptible to heart failure.
2. Develop a machine learning model to predict heart failure with the highest accuracy.
